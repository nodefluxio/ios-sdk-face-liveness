# Nodeflux iOS Face Liveness SDK

## Authenticate Your Customer's Face Liveness

Take advantage of our iOS SDK to authenticate your client's facial liveness. With a combination of active and passive liveness technology, protect your application/business from attempted falsification of client data.

This SDK provides some sets of activities to check the selfie is spoofed or real for the purpose of biometric verification. The SDK gives you some benefits to create better onboarding flow during the verification process, such as:
1. Double spoof checking by performing AI model combination of active liveness process and passive liveness.

2. Carefully designed simple UI to guide your customers to perform motion checking for preventing liveness attacks.

3. Secure the spoofing activity by filtering artificial input such as masks, print attacks, and replay attacks.
